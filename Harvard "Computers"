In the late 1800s, Edward Charles Pickering started collecting a large collection of photographic plates of stars. Due to the large amounts of data, he hired a bunch of women to compute and catalog the extensive data they were getting at only 25 cents an hour. They were known as the Harvard “Computers.” Initially, their job was to compute the actual positions and brightness of the stars, but as time went on, many were able to make sense of the patterns and started store these stars in different categories. One woman named Annie Jump Cannon created a stellar classification system that ranges from 7 different letters (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) which went from the hottest to the coolest. The sun is considered a G star, while M stars are considered red dwarfs, and O stars considered blue giants. She was able to make these distinctions by associating them with the temperature of hydrogen. Soon after in 1922, the International Astronomical Union adopted this system as its official classification method and it is something we still use today. She also went on to find over 2400 variable stars which all have a consistent luminosity.
